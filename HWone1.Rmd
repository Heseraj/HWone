```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(dslabs)
data("mtcars")
head(mtcars)
data("heights")
head(heights)


maleH <- heights %>% filter(sex == "Male") %>% select(height)
head(maleH)

femaleH <- heights %>% filter(sex == "Femae") %>% select(height)



```
So hours of work has been done to take care of this stuff but unfortunately, I am still not able to synch my work with repo. 
```{r}
hist(maleH)
boxplot(maleH)

```

So, It has been two days that I've not come here. Lets try to solve it. 

```{r}
data("crimtab")
head(crimtab)
tail(crimtab)

```
