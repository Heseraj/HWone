This is a new  work
So lets start working o it. 

```{r}
library(dslabs)
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
data("heights")
maleH <- heights %>% filter(sex == "Male") %>% select(height)
head(maleH)

```

This is to practice whether I've made the right move. 

```{r}
data("AirPassengers")
View(AirPassengers)
nrow(AirPassengers)
mean(AirPassengers)
sd(AirPassengers)


```
